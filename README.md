- 👋 Hi, I’m Shreyas Patil (@ShreyasSPatil)
- 👀 I’m interested in solving primarily AgriTech problems and secondarily management problems using Data Science techniques.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ways Deep Learning can be used to solve AgTech problems like LiveStock Detection through Aerial Footage.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data-Driven AgriTech applications. I am currently working on building a data science content series in Audio, Video and Text formats to share my diverse experience and knowledge. I am open for collaboration with anyone who is interested.
- 💻 I have been working in the field of Information Techology for 10+ years now and I am comfortable with 20+ programming languages and numerous technologies.
- 📫 You can reach me on ssp289@njit.edu or shreyasp50@gmail.com
